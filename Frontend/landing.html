                    <p>Franka honestly is the kind of therapeutic relationship that I have been dreaming of for some time. I feel heard, she has amazing insights that, even as someone who is always reflecting on myself and my actions, I feel like I
                         have never asked myself before. Although I've only had 2 sessions, I feel like I will really do some major healing with Franka because I am feeling a level of understanding about why I am seeking comfort in harmful actions 
                         and emotional disconnection this early on already. And not only this but Franka is very warm and provides exactly the kind of safe space for myself who is used to all manner of self abuse.</p>
